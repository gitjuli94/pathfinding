# Pathfinding
Comparison between two path finding algorthms Dijkstra and JPS (Jump Point Search).

## Maps
Maps downloaded from the [MovingAI Benchmarks](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/street/index.html "Moving AI Lab Map Benchmarks") and modified into arrays with "1" and "0", the first being obstacle and the latter being free space. The conversion was done with a [python script](https://github.com/gitjuli94/pathfinding/blob/main/additional_scripts/maptolist.py "python script").
