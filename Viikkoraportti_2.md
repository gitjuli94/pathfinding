# Weekly report 2

1. This week I programmed a script that reads .map files and writes them into 2D maps with "1/0" syntax. I used the maps that were available in [MovingAI Benchmarks](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/street/index.html.). Also, I have started to program the essence of the project. I started by using the Dijkstra algorithm and adding it a separate script that interprets the 2D maps and creates a network with nodes and edges accordingly. I also started to learn about testing and installed the required testing packages for my project. I started to create the unit testing script for dijkstra. I used aprox. 15 hours this week on the project.
2. The Dijkstra algorithm works now with 2D maps with the 1/0 syntax. The testing has been initialized and there is now one test function for dijkstra.
3. I learned on how to do testing, the topic was completely new to me, I had only used pylint before. I read a lot about unit testing and will expand the unit testing module for dijkstra algorithm.
4. What are the depencies in poetry? I didn't understand how to find out the required depencies for my project. I also struggled a bit with the testing, I have to find more information on what kind of unit tests should I create for path finding algorithms, the example unit testing was so different to my project. Most of my time this week went to understanding how to do testing (I haven't done the ohjelmistotuotanto course yet).
5. Next week I have to go more deeply into testing and get it working on my dijkstra algorithm, so that I can proceed to the JPS algorithm and its testing with more knowhow. I also have to start creating the JPS algorithm.
