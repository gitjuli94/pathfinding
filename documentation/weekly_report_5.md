# Weekly report 5

1. This week I added a function to the path finding algorithm to list all the shortest pathest (not only the first found). I continued on unit testing for dijkstra, graph, JPS and network. I fixed an issue in the graph algorithm (the one that creates a graph for the JPS algorithm) which came up when creating unit testing. Adjacent edges weren't correctly created. I did the peer review on a project about 15 game. I also started the integration testing. I used aprox. 19 hours this week on the project.
2. The project GUI is at the same state as last week. The testing has been advanced to unit and integration testing. The jump point visualization is still missing from the application.
3. I learned on unit testing and understood that its a good way to find bugs in the code.
4. It was difficult to review others code in the peer review, especially since the app didnt function properly yet. It took me several hours. I haven't revised other persons code before (a students code I mean).
5. I have to advance in integration testing and documentation and find the way to visualize correct jump points with JPS. I also have to add the final maps to the application, now it runs with simpler maps. The GUI has to be updated so that the maps with the screen.
