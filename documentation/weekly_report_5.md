# Weekly report 4

1. This week I added a function to list all the shortest pathest (not only the first found). I continued on unit testing for dijkstra, graph and network. I fixed an issue in the graph algorithm (the one that creates a graph for the JPS algorithm) which came up when creating unit testing. Adjacent edges weren't correctly created. I used aprox. xx hours this week on the project.
2. Both algorithms can be run with the application window (tkinter). The app shows the running time, path length and visited nodes. It also visualizes the route. There are two simple maps on which the algorithms can be run now. The bigger city pixel maps will be included later.
3. I learned to do a GUI for my project. Also, I understood the testing better now after the mondays lecture.
4. JPS and Dijkstra now sometimes find different routes but with the same distance. Should I include all the possible routes for the testing? Because now I can't compare these different routes, only the distances. Should I visualize the jump points for the JPS? Can you point out any other deficiency in my project now, besides the testing?
5. I have to advance in testing, it's still very incomplete. I have started it only for Dijkstra.
