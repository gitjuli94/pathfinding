# Weekly report 3

1. This week I studied more the JPS algorithm. I added the JPS algorithm to my project and got it to function with the same 1/0 syntax maps that were used for dijkstra the previous week. Now both algotihms work with the map inputs but they still need modification to make the layout unified. I started the testing document. I expanded the unit testing for dijkstra. I used aprox. 7 hours this week on the project (due to being sick).
2. Both algorithms work now with 2D maps with the 1/0 syntax and record the running time. The unit testing has been initialized for Dijkstra but it needs improvements.
3. I learned about JPS algorithm's features and tried to understand its functionality.
4. Unit testing is still somewhat strange topic to me, maybe on monday's lecture I'll learn more. Do I need to make some platform to run the algorithms and visualize the routes? Is there a difference if heapq or priorityqueue is used for these algorithms? Now I have heapq for Dijkstra and priorityqueue for JPS.
5. I have to advance more in the unit testing and understand in detail the JPS algorithm, I wasn't able to create unit testing to it yet.
