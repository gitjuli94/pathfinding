# Implementation document
This document describes the implementation details of the project for path finding algorithms. It provides information about how the path finding application is designed and executed with the chosen algorithms.

## Project overview
The project centers around comparing two distinct pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra and JPS (Jump Point Search). It involves the development of a locally deployable application capable of executing both algorithms, visualizing the resulting routes, and displaying relevant metrics. Users have the flexibility to select the starting and ending points on a pixel map within the application interface.

## Technologies used

### Programming language
The project is programmed with Python.
### Dependency management
Dependency management is implemented using Poetry.
### Frameworks and libraries
The application is built using Tkinter for the GUI. Other frameworks and libraries used in the project are:
* NumPy
* Poetry
* Queue
* Heapq
* Math
* Collections
* Time

### Development tools
The version control of the project is done with Git and the project's repository is in GitHub.
### Deployment platforms
The application can be deployed locally using Tkinter as the GUI library.

## Algorithms and data structures
Two different existing algorithms are implemented within the project: Dijkstra and JPS. Data structures are lists, dictionaries, tuples, heaps and sets.

### Path finding algorithms
#### Dijkstra
#### Jump Point Search
### Helper functions
#### Graph
#### Network
